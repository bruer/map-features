# Map Features
Display geographical data (fetched from [Open Street Map API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API)) for an area on a map, by specifying coordinates for the area of interest. 

The OSM data is converted to [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/), in order to be rendered in the map provided by [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/).
